              accepted
              into a 6 month scholarship program for front end web development through Udacity. In the first three
              months
              prior, I had learned all the basic parts of Html,
              CSS, and Javascript. I am now able to create and manage webpages at thier basic level. I plan on doing
              and
              learning much more. Below you will find all the projects and coding I have been working on. </p>
